## About the Game
The Guess Number Game was crafted as part of the Java Fundamentals course provided by the Software Development Academy. The user must guess a number within a range set by the system. With each guess, the system provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The goal is to guess the number in the fewest attempts possible.

## How to Play
1. The game begins by prompting the player to select the highest value for the number they'd like to guess.
2. The player provides a number as a guess.
3. The game gives feedback based on the guess - if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number. At the end, the player is informed of how many attempts it took and the total time.
